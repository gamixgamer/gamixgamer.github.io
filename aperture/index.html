<h2> Introduction to what we do </h2> 

<p> Here at Aperture Science, we believe science isn't about <strong> why </strong>, it's about <strong> why not! </strong> <br>
</p>

<p> We here at Aperture Science pride ourselves on our state-of-the-art technology and ambition to achieve the impossible! </p>

<p> Aperture Science has 4 main goals to complete for each day to be considered a success: </p>

<ul>
	<li> Treat each day as a new day to accomplish science. </li>
	<li> Create tremendouse advances/breakthroughs in technology </li>
	<li> Do all the testing we can </li>
	<li> Take down Black Mesa (WIP) </li>
</ul>

<h2> Introduction to what <em> you </em> can do </h2>
